            You measure your water intake, count your steps and monitor your
            heart rate — but how well do you understand your menstrual cycle?

            <br />
            <br />Despite being a monthly occurrence, it’s easy to lose track of
            when your period is due or what symptoms you experience throughout
            the month (especially if you use birth control that suppresses
            bleeding).

            <br />
            <br />
            An easy solution? Tracking your period. Whether you’re tired of
            surprise visits from Aunt Flo or you want to get a handle on
            symptoms (looking at you, mood swings) tracking your cycle can help
            you get in touch with your body and take control of your health.
          </p>

          <h2 style="text-align: center">Why should you track your period?</h2>
          <br />

          <br />
          <p>
            Period tracking is like a multitool for monitoring your health. It
            can help you track fertility to achieve pregnancy, act as birth
            control, keep tabs on potential health concerns and provide insight
            on symptoms like cravings, pain and changes in libido and mood.

            <br /><br />
            In other words, it helps you see patterns and learn what’s normal
            for your body. This way, you can prepare for any gnarly premenstrual
            syndrome (PMS) or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) symptoms
            and increase or decrease your likelihood of pregnancy based on your
            goals.
